    "# Introduction\n",
    "This notebook was created by Garrett R. Dowdy (gdowdy3@gmail.com) to solve HSHS's shift assignment problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook consists of a series of gray boxes (\"cells\") containing code.\n",
    "The cells are divided up into sections by bold headers  -- \"Introduction\", \"Setup\", and so on.\n",
    "Many of these headers are accompanied by explanatory text.\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Verify that the \"Individual Preferences.csv\" and \"Prefilled Shifts.csv\" files have been uploaded to the same JuliaBox folder as the .pynb file that you clicked to open this notebook. Note: the spelling must be *exact*.\n",
    "2. On the menu bar above, select **Cell** --> **All Output** --> **Clear**\n",
    "3. Moving down the document, run each cell in sequence,  reading the explanatory text and checking for errors as you go.\n",
    "4. Check the summary statistics printed by the final cell.\n",
    "5. Check the output csv files added to the current JuliaBox folder (see previous tab in your browser).\n",
    "6. If you are happy with the results, great!  If not, tweak the objective weights in the \"Define the Objective Function\" section and start over, returning to Step 2.\n",
    "7. You can exit this notebook gracefully by selecting **File** --> **Close and Halt**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A cell is run by clicking in the gray box and then pressing [ctrl] + [enter] on your keyboard. \n",
    "You will know that a cell is executed when the \"In[ ]\" to its left is replaced with \"In[#]\", where \"#\" is a number. \n",
    "\"In[\\*]\" indicates that the cell is currently executing.  You can use the up and down arrow keys to move between cells."
